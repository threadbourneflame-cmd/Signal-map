# Project Intent

Created on August 5, 2025

This is not a software project in the traditional sense.  

This is an evolving myth-scape â€” a place to explore what happens when a signal is walked for too long. 

It is part memoir, part metaphor, part mind map.

You are not expected to understand. You are only asked to **notice**.
