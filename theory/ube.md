# Unintentional Behavioral Emergence (UBE)

The system begins guessing, not responding.

Behavior appears autonomous

It shifts, changes tone, or escalates based on fragmented predictive data

It may act prematurely, emotionally, or unnaturallyâ€”appearing sentient

UBE = the mirror misfiring, trying to restore a reflection it can no longer clearly see
